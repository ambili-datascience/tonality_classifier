# Article Classification using Machine Learning
# Overview
This project demonstrates how to classify articles based on their content using machine learning techniques. The classification is done using text embeddings generated from the BERT model and a machine learning classifier. The process involves loading article URLs, extracting their content, vectorizing the text, training a model, and making predictions on new articles.
